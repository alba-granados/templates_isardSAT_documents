@article{Halimi2014a,
abstract = {The concept of delay/Doppler (DD) altimetry (DDA) has been under study since the mid-1990s, aiming at reducing the measurement noise and increasing the along-track resolution in comparison with the conventional pulse-limited altimetry. This paper introduces a new model for the mean backscattered power waveform acquired by a radar altimeter operating in synthetic aperture radar mode, as well as an associated least squares (LS) estimation algorithm. As in conventional altimetry (CA), the mean power can be expressed as the convolution of three terms: the flat surface impulse response (FSIR), the probability density function of the heights of the specular scatterers, and the time/frequency point target response of the radar. An important contribution of this paper is to derive an analytical formula for the FSIR associated with DDA. This analytical formula is obtained for a circular antenna pattern, no mispointing, no vertical speed effect, and a uniform scattering. The double convolution defining the mean echo power can then be computed numerically, resulting in a 2-D semi-analytical model called the DD map (DDM). This DDM depends on three altimetric parameters: the epoch, the sea surface wave height, and the amplitude. A multi-look model is obtained by summing all the reflected echoes from the same along-track surface location of interest after applying appropriate delay compensation (range migration) to align the DDM on the same reference. The second contribution of this paper concerns the estimation of the parameters associated with the multi-look semi-analytical model. An LS approach is investigated by means of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Simulations conducted on simulated altimetric waveforms allow the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm to be appreciated. The analysis of Cryosat-2 waveforms shows an improvement in parameter estimation when compared to the CA. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Halimi2015a,
abstract = {Delay/Doppler altimetry (DDA) aims at reducing the measurement noise and increasing the along-track resolution in comparison with conventional pulse-limited altimetry. In a previous paper, we have proposed a semi-analytical model for DDA, which considers some simplifications as the absence of mispointing antenna. This paper first proposes a new analytical expression for the flat surface impulse response (FSIR), considering antenna mispointing angles, a circular antenna pattern, no vertical speed effect, and uniform scattering. The 2-D delay/Doppler map is then obtained by a numerical computation of the convolution between the proposed analytical function, the probability density function of the heights of the specular scatterers, and the time/frequency point target response of the radar. The approximations used to obtain the semi-analytical model are analyzed, and the associated errors are quantified by analytical bounds for these errors. The second contribution of this paper concerns the estimation of the parameters associated with the multilook semi-analytical model. Two estimation strategies based on the least squares procedure are proposed. The proposed model and algorithms are validated on both synthetic and real waveforms. The obtained results are very promising and show the accuracy of this generalized model with respect to the previous model assuming zero antenna mispointing. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

@article{Brown1977,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theoretical model for short pulse scattering from a statistically random planar surface with particular application to current state of the art radar altimetry. A short review of the assumptions inherent in the convolutional model is presented. Simplified expressions are obtained for both the impulse response and the average backscattered power for near normal. incidence under the assumptions common to satellite radar altimetry systems. In particular, it is shown that the conventional two-dimensional surface integration can be reduced. to a closed form solution. Two applications of these results are presented relative to radar altimetry, namely, radar antenna pointing angle determination and altitude bias correction for pointing angle and surface roughness effects. It is also shown that these results have direct application to the analysis of the two frequency system proposed by Weissman, and a possible combined long pulse altimeter and two frequency system is suggested. {\textcopyright} 1977, IEEE.
