abstract = {The backscatters power single-look waveform recorded by a synthetic aperture radar altimeter is approximated in a closed-form model. The model, being expressed in terms of parameterless functions, allows for efficient computation of the waveform and a clear understanding of how the various sea state and instrument parameters affect the waveform. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},
